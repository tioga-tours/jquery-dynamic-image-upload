Resize images in the browser using a canvas.


[Demo](https://tech.tiogatours.nl/jquery-dynamic-image-upload/sample.htm)

Supports:

- Support drag-n-drop
- Support file selection
- AJAX file upload
- [OPTIONAL] Better resize with [limby-resize](https://github.com/danschumann/limby-resize)
- [OPTIONAL] Use [speedtest](https://github.com/tioga-tours/jquery-speedtest) to auto-select the best upload quality.
- [OPTIONAL] Extract EXIF data with [exif-js](https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js)

It helps for uploads over slow internet connections and uploads file by file, so not all the progress is lost
when the connection drops.
